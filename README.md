# Algerian-Forest-Fires
problem statement
Fire is the main cause of forest destruction in the countries of the Mediterranean Basin.
About 50000 fires sweep through 700 000 to 1 million hectares of Mediterranean forests, wooded lands and other land types each year.
Understanding the reasons why fires start is, therefore, a crucial factor in preventing or reducing their incidence, developing significant prevention efforts and designing specific fire prevention campaigns
